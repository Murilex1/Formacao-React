## Box Models
 Each element is represented as a rectangular box. Determining the size, properties - such as their color, background, border style - and position of these boxes is the goal of the rendering engine.

 ## Pseudo-classes
 Example:
    Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering
 ```
    button:hover{
        color:blue;
    }
 ```

 ## Media Queries
 ```
    <style>
    @media (max-width: 600px)
    {
        .facet_sidebar
        {
            display: none;
        }
    }
    </style>
 ```
